# Machine Learning Specialization
Everyday Machine Learning with Andrew NG.This repo includes different use cases of machine learning that I covered for earning ML specialization !
The projects covered are :
1. Implementing Kmeans algorithm considering random intitalization . Further compressing the image using Kmeans.
2. Anomaly detection system to detect failing servers in the network traffic.
3. A collaborative filtering recommender system for recommending movies using Tensorflow.

The list will keep updating....
